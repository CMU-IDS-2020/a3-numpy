TODO: Short abstract describing the main goals and how you achieved them.

## Project Goals

Our project is an online Airbnb data visualization tool for San Fransisco area. The potential users are the hosts on Airbnb or those who are thinking about becoming a host on Airbnb. 

For those who are currently a host on Airbnb, this tool can help them better pricing their house, and help them understand how to make their customers willing to pay more for their house.

For those who are thinking about becomming an Airbnb host, this tool can help them make an estimation on how much they could charge for their house, and decide if it is a good idea to become a host on Airbnb.


TODO: **A clear description of the goals of your project.** Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.Â 

## Design

We had a brief discussion on the factors which could affect the pricing of a house. We believe that there are several factors which would affect the price the most:  room type, location, number of bedrooms, review ratings.

We both agree that the map is the best way to visualize the location of the houses, and we need graphs to display the relationship between price and other data. For the graph, we both agree that scatter plot would show the correlation best. 

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

## Development

We first schedual a meeting to discuss what data we want to investigate, and we both find that Airbnb data is very interesting. Then it took us about an hour to briefly discuss the design our application, including the visualization encoding of each categories of data and different sections of our webpage. 

Andong: I was in charge of the scatter plots at the bottom of the webpage, and I made some final polishing for the UI. It took me about 10 hours to develop the application. 

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
